# Model Card, syn-IMM computational simulator## Model details- **Model name:** Synthetic Inner Mitochondrial Membrane (syn-IMM) Simulator- **Model type:** Mechanistic, dynamical systems model, ordinary difference equations at fixed timestep, with optional Monte Carlo sampling.- **Core states:**  - Baseline notebook, ?? proxy, exported ATP.  - Extension notebook, ?? (mV), ?pH (pH units), ?p (mV), CoQ redox pool fraction (QH2), supercomplex fraction S(t).- **Primary outputs:** ??, ?pH, ?p, ATP synthesis rate, exported ATP rate, accumulated ATP, CoQ redox state, supercomplex fraction.## Intended use- Hypothesis testing about which IMM modules dominate performance, cardiolipin dependence, leak sensitivity, and transport limitations.- Building intuition for design tradeoffs in a synthetic membrane context.- Generating figures and tables for conceptual, educational, or proposal work.## Out of scope- Predicting absolute rates in a specific experimental preparation without re-calibration.- Replacing biophysical, structural, or kinetic measurements in real membranes.- Any wet-lab design or execution guidance.## Training dataThis is not a trained statistical model, there is no training dataset. Parameters are chosen by calibration to ranges reported in scientific journal-indexed literature and by internal consistency checks.## Key scientific assumptions1. **?p partition** is approximated by ?p (mV) = ?? + 60·?pH, a widely used Nernst conversion. Perry et al., 2011. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3115691/2. **Cardiolipin dependence** is represented as a functional modifier of organization and supercomplex stability, consistent with cardiolipin’s requirement for supercomplex formation in classic reconstitution and stability studies. Zhang et al., 2002. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12364341/3. **ATP synthase dependence on pmf** is modeled as a steep nonlinear function of ?p, capturing the experimentally observed threshold-like behavior of ATP synthesis vs driving force in reconstituted systems, the exact curve is parameterized for plausibility. Kaim and Dimroth, 1998. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9738451/4. **CoQ pool** is finite and introduces redox buffering and saturation effects, with pool sizes anchored to tissue-scale measurements. Burger et al., 2020. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6975167/5. **Supercomplex fraction S(t)** is a kinetic state with CL-dependent k_on and k_off, used as a minimal abstraction of dynamic organization, not a structural resolution model. Zhang et al., 2002. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12364341/## EvaluationWe use pragmatic acceptance tests rather than formal predictive accuracy.### Qualitative acceptance criteria- Stable ?? and ?p in physiological ranges under low leak, and collapse under high leak.- ATP output increases with improved coupling, increased ATP synthase capacity, and favorable cardiolipin range, and decreases with increased leak or transport limitation.- CoQ redox pool shows saturating behavior, qh2 approaches 1 when oxidation is limiting, approaches 0 when reduction is limiting.- Supercomplex fraction increases with cardiolipin and affects throughput in the expected direction.### Quantitative sanity checks (typical targets)- ?? ~150–180 mV range is a common physiological reference. Brand and Nicholls, 2011. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3076726/- Cardiolipin in IMM is frequently reported around 15–20% of phospholipids. Pennington et al., 2019. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6482085/## Limitations- Lumped kinetics, no explicit Complex I, III, IV mechanistic intermediates, and no explicit proton stoichiometry mapping to ?? and ?pH beyond a simplified gain model.- No explicit ROS generation, and no explicit cytochrome c pool dynamics.- Supercomplex state S(t) is a coarse abstraction, not a structural model.- Parameter uncertainty is large across organisms, tissues, detergents, and reconstitution methods, Monte Carlo exploration is provided to handle uncertainty qualitatively.## Ethical and safety notesThis model is intended for benign scientific use, education, and research planning. It does not provide experimental assembly protocols.## References, PubMed indexedAnderson, S., et al. (1981). Sequence and organization of the human mitochondrial genome.
