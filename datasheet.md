# DataSheet, syn-IMM computational simulations

## Motivation
This project generates synthetic time-series data representing bioenergetic states and fluxes of a modeled inner mitochondrial membrane. The synthetic datasets enable controlled analysis of how module capacities and membrane composition influence Δp stability and ATP output.

## Composition
### What is “the data”
The primary outputs are pandas DataFrames generated within notebooks, commonly containing:
- `t_min`, time (minutes)
- `psi_mV`, Δψ (mV)
- `dpH`, ΔpH (pH units)
- `dp_mV`, Δp (mV), computed as Δψ + 60·ΔpH
- `qh2_frac`, fraction of CoQ pool in reduced form
- `S_supercomplex`, supercomplex fraction
- `J_red`, CoQ reduction flux proxy
- `J_ox`, CoQH2 oxidation flux proxy
- `J_e`, net electron throughput proxy
- `J_ATP`, ATP synthesis flux (nmol/min/mg)
- `J_export`, exported ATP flux (nmol/min/mg), limited by transport caps
- `ATP_ext`, accumulated exported ATP (nmol/mg)

There is no personally identifiable information, no patient data, and no experimental organism data.

## Data generation process
### Overview
Data are generated by explicit dynamical updates (difference equations) with fixed timestep `dt`, and parameter settings chosen by calibration to PubMed-indexed literature ranges.

### Parameter provenance, Scientific Journal anchors
- Δp partition conversion, Δp ≈ Δψ + 60·ΔpH (mV), standard Nernst approximation context. Perry et al., 2011. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3115691/
- Cardiolipin-dependent supercomplex organization, cardiolipin requirement for supercomplex stability. Zhang et al., 2002. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12364341/
- Representative cardiolipin fraction in IMM, often ~15–20%. Pennington et al., 2019. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6482085/
- CoQ pool quantification examples, nmol CoQ per mg protein, used to anchor `CoQ_total`. Burger et al., 2020. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6975167/
- ATP synthesis dependence on driving force in proteoliposomes, informs nonlinear ATP vs Δp shape. Kaim and Dimroth, 1998. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9738451/
- ANT reconstitution transport benchmarks used to set default high transport caps. Kreiter et al., 2020. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7277544/

### Randomness
Monte Carlo sensitivity uses numpy random sampling with a fixed seed in notebooks for reproducibility. Rerunning with a different seed changes sampled parameter sets but not the underlying simulator logic.

## Recommended uses
- Sensitivity analysis, parameter screening, robustness exploration.
- Figure generation for proposals, teaching, or conceptual review articles.
- Model debugging and unit consistency checks for larger mechanistic frameworks.

## Uses that should be avoided
- Treating simulation outputs as experimental measurements.
- Inferring clinically actionable conclusions.
- Estimating absolute ATP production in a specific preparation without calibration to that system.

## Distribution
The synthetic data are generated on demand by running notebooks. You may export CSV files under `results/` if desired, the repository does not need to ship precomputed outputs.

## Maintenance
If you update the simulator equations or parameters:
1. Record the change in a changelog.
2. Re-run baseline and perturbation panels.
3. Re-generate summary tables and ensure acceptance criteria still behave as expected.
